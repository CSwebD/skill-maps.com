# 🧭 Agile Implementation – Skill Maps Platform

## 📘 Project Overview
This project follows the **Agile (Scrum)** methodology to build and continuously improve the **Skill Maps** platform — a web application designed to help users learn and track their technical skills through interactive roadmaps.

The platform allows users to:
- Explore curated skill roadmaps (Frontend, DevOps, AI, etc.)
- Track personal progress
- Receive learning recommendations
- Engage with new content shared by the community

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

| Category | Tool |
|-----------|------|
| **Version Control** | [GitHub](https://github.com/) |
| **Project Management** | GitHub Projects (Kanban board) |
| **Development Stack** | React, Node.js / Express, MongoDB (or similar) |
| **Collaboration** | Slack / Discord for daily syncs |
| **Analytics** | Google Analytics, social media insights |
| **Deployment** | Vercel / Netlify (Frontend), Render / AWS / Azure (Backend) |

## 📊 Collaboration Workflow
1. Each feature or fix is tracked as a **GitHub Issue**.  
2. Issues are organized in the **GitHub Project Kanban board** under:
   - 🟩 To Do  
   - 🟨 In Progress  
   - 🟦 In Review  
   - 🟪 Done  
3. Branch naming convention:  
   - `feature/feature-name`  
   - `fix/bug-description`  
4. All merges require peer review (at least one approval).  

---

## 📈 Marketing & Analytics
The marketolog plays a vital role in growth and feedback:
- Publishes posts about new features and learning content  
- Runs social media campaigns (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram)  
- Collects data from Google Analytics and shares insights with the team  
- Suggests improvements based on user activity and engagement trends  

---

## 💬 Feedback & Continuous Improvement
User feedback is collected through:
- Contact form and feedback surveys  
- Social media comments and messages  
- Google Analytics usage data  

Insights from these sources feed into new **user stories** added to the Product Backlog for future sprints.

## 🧠 Agile Values in Practice
We adhere to the four core Agile values:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan
