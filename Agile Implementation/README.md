# 🧭 Agile Implementation – Skill Maps Platform

## 📘 Project Overview
This project follows the **Agile (Scrum)** methodology to build and continuously improve the **Skill Maps** platform — a web application designed to help users learn and track their technical skills through interactive roadmaps.

The platform allows users to:
- Explore curated skill roadmaps (Frontend, DevOps, AI, etc.)
- Track personal progress
- Receive learning recommendations
- Engage with new content shared by the community

### 🔁 Sprint Cycle
1. **Sprint Planning** – Define sprint goals and select backlog items  
2. **Daily Stand-ups** – Share progress and identify blockers  
3. **Development & Testing** – Build, test, and integrate features incrementally  
4. **Sprint Review** – Demonstrate deliverables to stakeholders and collect feedback  
5. **Sprint Retrospective** – Reflect on process improvements and lessons learned

## 🧠 Agile Principles in Practice

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan
