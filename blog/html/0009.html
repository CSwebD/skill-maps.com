      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-600">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        When I walked across the stage to receive my First Class Honours degree in Software Engineering from the University of Greenwich, I felt a mix of pride and uncertainty. I'd spent years learning algorithms, data structures, and programming languages, but the reality of entering the tech industry in London hit differently than I'd expected.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
        Now, working as an IT Service Desk Analyst whilst actively pursuing software engineering roles, I've gained insights that would have made my transition smoother. If you're a computer science or software engineering student preparing to graduate, here are five truths I wish someone had told me earlier.

          <p class="text-gray-700">My First Class Honours and solid academic record would open doors.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">The reality:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Recruiters spend an average of 6 seconds scanning your CV. What catches their eye isn't your grade — it's what you've <em class="text-blue-600 font-semibold">built</em>.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          During my final year, I developed a CI/CD automation project using TeamCity and GitHub that was nominated for the Best Project Award. That project has been mentioned in almost every interview I've had. Meanwhile, my excellent grades in theoretical modules? Rarely discussed.

          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">The reality:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">These programmes are incredibly competitive and often have lengthy application processes involving multiple video interviews, assessment centres, and technical tests that can take months.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          As someone whose first language isn't English, I found video interviews particularly challenging. The time investment for graduate schemes felt like a gamble when I needed to start earning.

      </p>
      <p class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4 italic">
        Your degree is the foundation, not the destination.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The real learning happens when you build things, navigate the job market, and adapt to the reality of the industry.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The path isn't always linear. It's fine if your first role isn't your dream job. It's fine if you take longer than expected to land your ideal position. It's fine if your journey looks different from your classmates'.
      </p>

        What matters is that you keep building, keep learning, and keep moving forward.
