        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-indigo-600">Why December Matters for Graduate Schemes</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          As someone actively navigating the graduate job market in London, I can tell you that December is absolutely crucial for your graduate scheme applications. Whilst many students are winding down for Christmas, the smartest candidates are getting their applications in before the new year rush.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Here's what most people don't realise: approximately seventy per cent of graduate scheme positions for September 2026 start dates will be filled by Christmas. The companies that haven't closed applications by December are often the ones operating on rolling admissions—meaning they review and offer places as applications come in, not after a deadline.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The maths is simple but stark. Final-year students who submit applications by October receive twenty-five per cent more interview invitations than those who wait until January. By the time January arrives, many schemes have already conducted first-round interviews and are extending offers to their top candidates.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This guide isn't about overwhelming you with every single graduate scheme out there. Instead, I've compiled practical insights from my own application experience, combined with research on what actually works in 2025. Whether you're targeting technology, finance, engineering, law, or something completely different, understanding how graduate schemes work—and how to stand out—can make all the difference.
