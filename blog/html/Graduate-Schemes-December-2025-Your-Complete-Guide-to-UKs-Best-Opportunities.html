        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-indigo-600">Why December Matters for Graduate Schemes</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          As someone actively navigating the graduate job market in London, I can tell you that December is absolutely crucial for your graduate scheme applications. Whilst many students are winding down for Christmas, the smartest candidates are getting their applications in before the new year rush.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Here's what most people don't realise: approximately seventy per cent of graduate scheme positions for September 2026 start dates will be filled by Christmas. The companies that haven't closed applications by December are often the ones operating on rolling admissions—meaning they review and offer places as applications come in, not after a deadline.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The maths is simple but stark. Final-year students who submit applications by October receive twenty-five per cent more interview invitations than those who wait until January. By the time January arrives, many schemes have already conducted first-round interviews and are extending offers to their top candidates.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This guide isn't about overwhelming you with every single graduate scheme out there. Instead, I've compiled practical insights from my own application experience, combined with research on what actually works in 2025. Whether you're targeting technology, finance, engineering, law, or something completely different, understanding how graduate schemes work—and how to stand out—can make all the difference.

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">1. Research & Preparation</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Start by thoroughly researching companies and their graduate schemes. Understand their values, culture, and what they're looking for in candidates. Make a list of 5-10 schemes that genuinely interest you rather than applying to dozens.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">2. Application Form</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Most graduate schemes require an online application form covering your academic background, work experience, and competency-based questions. Tailor each application to the specific company—generic applications rarely succeed. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for competency questions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">3. Online Tests</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Expect to complete numerical reasoning, verbal reasoning, and situational judgement tests. Practice these in advance using free resources. Most tests are timed, so familiarising yourself with the format helps manage time pressure.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">4. Video Interview</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Many schemes now use pre-recorded video interviews where you answer questions on camera. Prepare thoroughly, practice speaking clearly, and ensure good lighting and a professional background.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">5. Assessment Centre</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              The final stage typically includes group exercises, individual presentations, case studies, and formal interviews. Demonstrate teamwork, leadership, analytical thinking, and cultural fit. Be yourself—assessors are looking for authenticity as well as competence.
            </p>

            <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
              <li>• Start applications early—don't wait until the deadline</li>
              <li>• Customise every application to the specific scheme</li>
              <li>• Use concrete examples from your experience</li>
              <li>• Proofread everything multiple times</li>
              <li>• Ask for feedback if you're rejected</li>
              <li>• Track your applications in a spreadsheet</li>
              <li>• Follow up professionally after interviews</li>
