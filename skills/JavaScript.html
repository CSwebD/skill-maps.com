    <!-- WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT -->
    <section class="mb-12 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">What's the Deal with JavaScript?</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Here's something wild: JavaScript literally runs everywhere. That button you just clicked? JavaScript. The menu that slides out? JavaScript. The form that validated your email before you hit submit? You guessed it—JavaScript. If you've used the internet today (which, you're reading this, so yeah), you've interacted with JavaScript code dozens of times.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Unlike other programming languages that need special software to run, JavaScript runs right in your web browser. Chrome, Firefox, Safari—they all speak JavaScript natively. This makes it incredibly accessible. You don't need to install fancy development environments or configure complicated setups. If you can open a browser, you can start coding in JavaScript right now.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Created in just 10 days back in 1995 by Brendan Eich (talk about pressure!), JavaScript has evolved from a simple scripting language into the backbone of modern web development. Today, it powers everything from simple interactive buttons to complex applications like Gmail, Google Maps, and Netflix. It's not just for websites anymore—JavaScript runs on servers (Node.js), mobile apps (React Native), and even desktop applications (Electron).
      </p>
      <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-6 mt-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Why JavaScript is Different</h3>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Runs everywhere:</strong> Browsers, servers, mobile devices—JavaScript literally works on any platform</li>
          <li><strong>Instant feedback:</strong> Write code, refresh your browser, see results immediately. No compilation waiting time</li>
          <li><strong>Makes websites come alive:</strong> Without JavaScript, the web would be static and boring. JS adds interactivity and personality</li>
          <li><strong>Massive community:</strong> Millions of developers, countless tutorials, and someone has already solved your problem on Stack Overflow</li>
          <li><strong>Modern frameworks:</strong> React, Vue, Angular—the tools companies use are all JavaScript-based</li>
          <li><strong>Career goldmine:</strong> Every company building for the web needs JavaScript developers. Every. Single. One.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- WHY LEARN JAVASCRIPT -->
    <section class="mb-12 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Why Learn JavaScript in 2025?</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Let's cut through the noise: if you only learn one programming language for web development, make it JavaScript. Not because it's perfect (no language is), but because it's essential. You literally cannot build modern websites without it.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        But here's the really exciting part: JavaScript isn't just for front-end anymore. With Node.js, you can use JavaScript to build the entire application—front-end, back-end, database interactions, everything. This means you can become a full-stack developer knowing just one language. That's powerful, and companies love developers who can work across the entire stack.

          <p class="text-gray-700">Every website you visit uses JavaScript. Every web developer needs to know it. It's the only programming language that runs natively in web browsers. Learn JavaScript, and you can work on literally any web project.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">See your code work immediately in the browser. No compiling, no waiting. This instant feedback loop makes learning JavaScript incredibly satisfying. You write code, refresh, and boom—you see your creation come to life.</p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Good news: getting started with JavaScript is ridiculously easy compared to most programming languages. You probably already have everything you need. Seriously.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-6">The Bare Minimum</h3>
      <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>A web browser:</strong> Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge—any modern browser works perfectly. That's it. You can literally start coding right now.</li>
          <li><strong>A text editor:</strong> Notepad works, but VS Code is free and makes your life easier with syntax highlighting and autocomplete. Download it once, use it forever.</li>
          <li><strong>Basic HTML knowledge helps:</strong> JavaScript manipulates web pages, so understanding HTML basics makes things clearer. But you can learn them together—they're friends.</li>
          <li><strong>Time and patience:</strong> Let's be real—expect to spend 10-15 hours per week. You'll see progress within days, but mastery takes months. That's normal.</li>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Let's build something useful—a calculator that actually works. This isn't just about making buttons look pretty; you're learning how to handle user input, perform calculations, display results, and manage state (what numbers the user is working with). Every web app does these things, so this project teaches you fundamental patterns.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Why a calculator? Because it's complex enough to be interesting but simple enough that you can actually finish it. You'll work with event listeners (detecting button clicks), conditional logic (which operation did they choose?), and DOM manipulation (updating the display). These skills transfer to every JavaScript project you'll ever build.

          Time for your portfolio centerpiece. This quiz app combines everything you've learned into one polished project. You'll manage question data, track scores, handle user input, provide feedback, and create a complete user flow from start to finish.

          Why is this powerful? Because quiz apps are everywhere—education, training, games, surveys. Companies need developers who can build interactive experiences. This project proves you can do exactly that. Plus, it's actually fun to build and satisfying to show off.

        <p class="mb-4">Here's what nobody tells you: JavaScript mastery isn't about memorizing syntax or knowing every method. It's about building things repeatedly until patterns become second nature. Write code every day, even if just for 30 minutes. Build small things. Break stuff. Fix it. That's how you actually learn.</p>
