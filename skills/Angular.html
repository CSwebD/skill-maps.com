    <!-- WHAT IS ANGULAR -->
    <section class="mb-12 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">What's Angular All About?</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Angular has a reputation, and let's address it upfront: people say it's complex, opinionated, and has a steep learning curve. You know what? They're not wrong. Angular is complex—but here's the thing: enterprise applications are complex. Angular gives you the tools to manage that complexity at scale. It's not the easiest framework to learn, but it might be the most powerful.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Built and maintained by Google, Angular is a complete platform for building web applications. Not just a library—a full framework with opinions about architecture, testing, routing, forms, HTTP requests, everything. This "batteries included" approach means you're not cobbling together a dozen libraries and hoping they work together. Angular provides the complete package, battle-tested at massive scale.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Who uses Angular? Google (obviously), Microsoft for Office 365 and Xbox, Forbes, BMW, and countless banks and healthcare companies. These aren't startups moving fast and breaking things—these are enterprises that need applications to work reliably for millions of users over years. That's Angular's sweet spot. It's designed for projects where structure, maintainability, and scalability matter more than quick prototyping.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 mt-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Why Angular Stands Out</h3>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Complete framework:</strong> Everything you need is included and designed to work together seamlessly</li>
          <li><strong>TypeScript by default:</strong> Strong typing catches errors before they reach production. Your IDE becomes incredibly helpful</li>
          <li><strong>Enterprise-grade:</strong> Built for large teams and long-term maintenance. Code structure is enforced and predictable</li>
          <li><strong>Powerful CLI:</strong> Generate components, services, modules with single commands. Consistency across your codebase</li>
          <li><strong>RxJS integration:</strong> Handle complex asynchronous operations elegantly. Power and complexity in one package</li>
          <li><strong>Google backing:</strong> Long-term support and regular updates. Angular isn't going anywhere</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- WHY LEARN ANGULAR -->
    <section class="mb-12 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Why Learn Angular in 2025?</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Let's be real: Angular doesn't have the hype of React or the developer love of Vue. But here's what it does have: enterprise adoption. If you want to work on large-scale applications for big companies, Angular knowledge opens doors. Banks, insurance companies, healthcare systems, government projects—they love Angular because it enforces structure and scales well.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The learning curve is steeper, yes. You need to understand TypeScript, RxJS, dependency injection, and Angular's specific patterns. But once you climb that curve, you're incredibly valuable. Angular developers are in high demand precisely because fewer people know it well. Less competition, higher salaries, more opportunities at enterprise companies. That's the trade-off.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3"><i class="fas fa-building text-red-600 mr-2"></i>Enterprise Focus</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Angular dominates enterprise environments. Fortune 500 companies, financial institutions, healthcare systems—they choose Angular for mission-critical applications. These companies pay well and value stability over trends.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3"><i class="fas fa-shield-alt text-blue-600 mr-2"></i>Structure & Standards</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Angular enforces best practices and architectural patterns. Large teams need consistency—Angular provides it. Your code looks like everyone else's Angular code. This makes collaboration and maintenance easier at scale.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-green-50 to-emerald-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3"><i class="fas fa-toolbox text-green-600 mr-2"></i>Complete Tooling</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Angular CLI is phenomenal. Generate entire features with a command. Built-in testing, production builds, deployment optimization—it's all there. You spend time solving problems, not configuring build tools.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-50 to-violet-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

    <!-- PREREQUISITES -->
    <section class="mb-12 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">What You Need to Know First</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Angular isn't a beginner's first framework—let's be honest about that. You should be comfortable with JavaScript before jumping into Angular and TypeScript. That said, if you've built a few projects with vanilla JS or jQuery, you're probably ready. Angular will push you, but that's how you grow.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-6">Prerequisites (Be Honest with Yourself)</h3>
      <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Strong JavaScript fundamentals:</strong> Variables, functions, arrays, objects, ES6 features. If these feel shaky, shore them up first. Angular will expose gaps quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>HTML & CSS proficiency:</strong> Angular templates are HTML with directives. You need solid HTML knowledge. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind pair well with Angular.</li>
          <li><strong>TypeScript basics helpful:</strong> Angular uses TypeScript exclusively. You can learn as you go, but understanding types, interfaces, and classes beforehand smooths the path.</li>
          <li><strong>Command line comfort:</strong> Angular CLI lives in the terminal. You'll use it constantly. Get comfortable with basic command line navigation.</li>
          <li><strong>Node.js and npm installed:</strong> Angular requires Node. Download from nodejs.org, install, and you're set.</li>
          <li><strong>Serious time commitment:</strong> Angular takes longer to learn than React or Vue. Plan for 15-20 hours per week minimum. The payoff is worth it, but don't underestimate the investment.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Your Development Environment</h3>

      <div class="bg-pink-50 border-l-4 border-pink-400 p-4 mt-6">
        <p class="text-gray-800"><strong>Reality check:</strong> Angular has more moving parts than other frameworks. Modules, components, services, dependency injection, RxJS—it's a lot at first. That's okay. You don't need to understand everything immediately. Start building, and understanding follows. The confusion is temporary; the skills are permanent.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>How to approach this:</strong> This course is several hours of dense material. Don't try to consume it all at once. Watch a section, code along immediately, experiment on your own, then move to the next section. Active learning beats passive watching. Build things alongside the course, not after.

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 mb-4">
          <p class="text-gray-800"><strong>Learning strategy:</strong> Angular's dependency injection will confuse you. RxJS observables will confuse you. That's normal—they confuse everyone at first. Don't let confusion stop you. Keep building, keep coding. Understanding comes through repetition, not revelation. Trust the process.</p>
