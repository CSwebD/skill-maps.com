      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">What is Docker? (And Why Should You Care?)</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Picture this: You spend hours getting your application working perfectly on your laptop. Dependencies installed, environment variables set, everything runs smoothly. Then you try to deploy it to a server, and... nothing works. Different OS, missing packages, conflicting versions. Sound familiar? That's the nightmare Docker solves.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Docker is containerization technology—think of it like shipping containers for your code. Just as physical shipping containers revolutionized global trade by making goods transportable anywhere, Docker containers package your application with everything it needs to run: code, runtime, libraries, dependencies, configuration. One container, runs everywhere. Your laptop, the cloud, your colleague's machine—doesn't matter. It just works.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Here's what makes Docker game-changing: Before Docker, developers said "it works on my machine" and shrugged. Now? If it works in a Docker container, it works everywhere. This isn't just convenient—it's transformed how the entire tech industry builds and deploys software. Companies like Netflix, Spotify, and Uber rely on Docker to deploy applications millions of times per day.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Why Docker Matters</h3>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Same environment from development to production—no more "works on my machine" excuses</li>
          <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Each application runs in its own container, preventing conflicts and making systems more stable</li>
          <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Build once, run anywhere—local machine, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, doesn't matter</li>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Containers start in seconds, not minutes. Deploy faster, iterate quicker, ship more often</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Lightweight compared to virtual machines—run more applications on the same hardware</li>
          <li><strong>DevOps essential:</strong> Docker is fundamental to modern CI/CD pipelines and cloud-native development</li>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Why Learn Docker in 2025?</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Let me be blunt: if you want to work in modern software development, you need Docker. It's not optional anymore. Check any DevOps or cloud engineering job posting—Docker is there. Even if you're a pure developer, understanding Docker makes you significantly more valuable. Why? Because you understand the full lifecycle of your application, not just the code.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The tech industry has shifted to containers. Microservices, cloud-native applications, Kubernetes—they all build on Docker. Learning Docker isn't just about adding a skill to your resume; it's about understanding how modern software actually gets built and deployed in production. It's the difference between knowing how to write code and knowing how to ship code.

    <section class="mb-12 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">What You Need to Get Started</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Docker has a bit of a learning curve—I won't lie about that. But it's not because Docker itself is complicated; it's because containers represent a different way of thinking about applications. Once the mental model clicks, everything makes sense. Here's what you need to begin.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-6">The Essentials</h3>
      <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Basic command line comfort:</strong> Docker lives in the terminal. You don't need to be a command line wizard, but you should be comfortable navigating directories and running commands.</li>
          <li><strong>Understanding of applications:</strong> Know how applications generally work—frontend, backend, databases. Docker packages these things, so understanding what you're packaging helps.</li>
          <li><strong>Docker Desktop installed:</strong> Free download for Windows, Mac, or Linux. This gives you Docker Engine (the core) and a nice GUI for managing containers.</li>
          <li><strong>Code editor:</strong> VS Code works great. The Docker extension is helpful but not required.</li>
          <li><strong>Time to experiment:</strong> Docker rewards experimentation. Plan for 10-15 hours per week to really grasp it. The concepts are worth the investment.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">System Requirements</h3>
      <div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
        <div class="border border-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Windows</h4>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Windows 10/11 with WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Docker Desktop makes setup straightforward. You'll be containerizing in 15 minutes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border border-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Mac</h4>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">macOS 10.15 or newer. Docker Desktop for Mac is polished and works beautifully. Apple Silicon (M1/M2) fully supported now.</p>

          Before diving into the weeds, let's get the 10,000-foot view. This video blazes through Docker concepts fast, and that's intentional. You won't understand everything first watch—that's fine. You're building mental scaffolding. Watch it, let the concepts wash over you, and don't stress about memorizing anything. Just get familiar with the vocabulary.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Now we build the foundation. This comprehensive course covers Docker from installation to deployment. You'll learn containers, images, volumes, networks, Docker Compose—everything. This is where Docker stops being abstract and becomes concrete. Follow along, code along, and give yourself permission to pause and experiment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Important:</strong> This course is meaty—over 2 hours. Break it into sessions. Watch 30 minutes, then experiment with what you learned before continuing. Trying to absorb everything at once is a recipe for overwhelm. Docker rewards practice, not marathon learning sessions.

          Time to level up. These projects walk you through containerizing real applications—web servers, databases, multi-service architectures. You'll use Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple containers, implement persistent storage with volumes, and configure container networking. This is Docker as it's used in production environments.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Why multiple projects? Because repetition builds mastery. Each project reinforces concepts while introducing new challenges. By project three, you'll be thinking in containers. When you see an application, you'll instinctively know how to containerize it. That's the goal.

              <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                <li>• Use `.dockerignore` files to keep images lean</li>
                <li>• Name your containers meaningfully (`web-app` not `container1`)</li>
                <li>• Keep Dockerfiles simple and readable—your future self will thank you</li>
                <li>• Use Docker Compose for local development—it's a game changer</li>
                <li>• Always specify image versions (don't use `latest` in production)</li>

              <p class="text-gray-700">Create a GitHub repo with all your Docker projects. Include clear README files explaining the architecture, how to run each project, and what you learned. Add architecture diagrams—even simple ones. This shows employers you don't just follow tutorials; you understand systems.</p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Take a second to appreciate what you've accomplished. Docker has a reputation for being complex, and you just conquered it. You can containerize applications, orchestrate multi-service architectures, and deploy to the cloud. These aren't beginner skills—this is what companies pay DevOps engineers six figures to do.

Once you think in containers, you'll wonder how you ever worked without them. You're not just running applications differently; you're building them better.</p>
